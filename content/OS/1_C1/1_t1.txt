Process Scheduling (FCFS, SJF, RR)
Process scheduling decides the execution order of processes:
- FCFS (First Come, First Serve): Executes processes in arrival order.
- SJF (Shortest Job First): Executes shortest tasks first.
- Round Robin (RR): Gives each process a fixed time slot in a cyclic order.
