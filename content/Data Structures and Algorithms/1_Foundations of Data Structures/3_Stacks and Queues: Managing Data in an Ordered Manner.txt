**Stacks and Queues: Managing Data in an Ordered Manner**

### Introduction

Data structures play a fundamental role in computer science by organizing and managing data efficiently. Among the most commonly used data structures are stacks and queues, both of which impose specific order constraints on how elements are inserted and removed. Stacks operate on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, whereas queues follow a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Understanding these structures is essential for efficient algorithm design and implementation in various domains, such as memory management, expression evaluation, process scheduling, and graph traversal.

### Stacks

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists and are commonly used in problems that require backtracking, recursion handling, and expression evaluation.

#### Stack Operations

1. **Push**: This operation inserts an element at the top of the stack. Since insertion always happens at the same end, this operation takes constant time, O(1).
2. **Pop**: This operation removes the top element from the stack. It also runs in O(1) time since it only modifies the top pointer.
3. **Peek (Top)**: This operation allows viewing the top element of the stack without removing it. It helps in decision-making processes where only the latest element is relevant.
4. **isEmpty**: A function that checks whether the stack is empty.
5. **isFull**: In array-based implementations, this function checks if the stack has reached its capacity.

#### Stack Implementation

Stacks can be implemented using:
- **Arrays** (Fixed-size stack)
- **Linked Lists** (Dynamic stack with no size limit)

##### Example: Stack Using an Array (Python)
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        return "Stack is empty"
    
    def peek(self):
        return self.stack[-1] if not self.is_empty() else "Stack is empty"
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0
```

#### Applications of Stacks

- **Function Call Stack**: The call stack maintains function calls in programming languages, ensuring that the most recent function completes before returning to previous calls.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to convert and evaluate expressions, such as infix to postfix notation.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Used in depth-first search (DFS), maze solving, and undo functionality in software applications.
- **Parenthesis Matching**: Ensuring correct syntax in code editors and compilers.

### Queues

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle. The element added first is the first to be removed, making queues ideal for scheduling and processing tasks sequentially.

#### Queue Operations

1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue (O(1)).
2. **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front of the queue (O(1)).
3. **Front (Peek)**: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
5. **isFull**: In fixed-size implementations, checks if the queue has reached its capacity.

#### Queue Implementation

Queues can be implemented using:
- **Arrays** (Fixed-size queue with circular buffering)
- **Linked Lists** (Dynamic queue without size constraints)
- **Two Stacks** (Simulating a queue using two stacks)

##### Example: Queue Using a List (Python)
```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)
        return "Queue is empty"
    
    def peek(self):
        return self.queue[0] if not self.is_empty() else "Queue is empty"
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0
```

#### Types of Queues

1. **Simple Queue**: Follows FIFO order strictly.
2. **Circular Queue**: The rear of the queue connects back to the front, optimizing space utilization.
3. **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than arrival order.
4. **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**: Elements can be added or removed from both ends.

#### Applications of Queues

- **CPU Scheduling**: Operating systems use queues for job scheduling.
- **Printer Job Scheduling**: Ensuring that print requests are handled in order.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used in graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.
- **Request Handling in Servers**: Web servers manage client requests using queues.

### Comparison Between Stacks and Queues
| Feature          | Stack (LIFO)         | Queue (FIFO)         |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Order of Processing | Last In, First Out | First In, First Out |
| Insert Operation | Push (O(1)) | Enqueue (O(1)) |
| Delete Operation | Pop (O(1)) | Dequeue (O(1)) |
| Usage Scenarios | Function calls, recursion, expression evaluation | Process scheduling, BFS, request handling |

### Conclusion

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures that manage data in an orderly manner. Stacks operate on a LIFO principle and are used extensively in function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms. Queues, on the other hand, work on a FIFO principle and are crucial for scheduling processes, handling requests, and graph traversals like BFS. By understanding these structures, developers can efficiently solve problems related to data organization and processing in various applications, ranging from operating systems to artificial intelligence.
