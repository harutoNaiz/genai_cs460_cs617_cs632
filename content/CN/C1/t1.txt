The difference between OSI and TCP/IP Model:
The OSI model has seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
The TCP/IP model simplifies this into four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application.
TCP/IP is more commonly used in real-world networking.
