<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This project introduces a fully automated, adaptive learning and evaluation platform designed to modernize traditional STEM assessments.
  It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create context-relevant questions and provide personalized learning paths.
</p>

<p>
  The system evolves based on student interaction, adjusting both question difficulty and topic coverage in real time. It significantly reduces educator workload while enhancing student learning outcomes.

<h2>Core Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Automate the creation of subject-specific and difficulty-adjusted questions using RAG</li>
  <li>Provide real-time adaptive feedback and difficulty tuning</li>
  <li>Enhance understanding by summarizing weak areas with increased coverage</li>
  <li>Reduce redundancy and optimize preparation time using semantic search and summarization</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>System Summary</h2>

<p>
  Created an AI-powered evaluation and content generation system that generates dynamic, customized assessments using RAG and historical performance data. The system begins with simpler questions and automatically increases difficulty based on user accuracy. It adapts content delivery by analyzing prior test performance, increasing focus on weak topics and reducing emphasis on well-understood areas. Features include confidence-based feedback, automated topic summarization, and real-time learning path adaptation.
